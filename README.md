# ML Pipeline for River Flow Estimation

This repository provides a machine learning pipeline designed to estimate **mean and low reference flows** for Brazilian river stretches. It includes scripts for **data collection, preprocessing, model training**, and **evaluation**.

---

## Steps
- **Data Collection**: Uses the Google Earth Engine Python API to gather hydrological and environmental data.
- **Data Processing**: Leverages topological information from the **Brazilian Hydrography Ottocodified (BHO)** for processing.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Evaluates six models to estimate river flow metrics.
- **Uncertainty Estimation**: Quantifies the reliability of predictions.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/barbedorafael/ml_pipeline.git
    cd ml_pipeline
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Install required libraries with:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Pipeline**:
    Modify the input parameters in `config.yaml` (or the relevant script) and execute:
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset generated by this pipeline will be publicly available on Zenodo. **[Link pending]**. The dataset includes:

- Raw input data collected via the pipeline.
- Processed features used in model training.
- Output predictions and uncertainty estimates.
